class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int,int> mp;

        for(auto x : nums)
        mp[x]++;

        int k = 0;
        for(auto x : mp)
        nums[k++] = x.first;

        return mp.size();
    }
};

/*
approach: 
since it is taking about unique elment so we can either use set of map[preferred]
what we have to do, put all elements in map [it will take care of ascending order as well as uniqueness]
then override nums element with map element
at end return mp.size() [gives out number of unique element ]
